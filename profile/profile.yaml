# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from McMaster University. I worked professinally as a Sales Engineer, and then moved to Belgium to work at Toyota Motor Europe as a Project Consultant on a major automotive recall. As project consultant, I was exposed to data analysis, forecasting and reporting while managing the recall database. With my interest in data analysis piqued, I took several introductory courses to understand automation as well as data structures and algorithms. I joined Jarvis as a Data Engineer to deepen my computer science understanding and programming abilities through practical training projects. Throughout each project I collaborated with a team using Agile/Scrum methodology, sharing and iterating solutions. I am motivated to continuously learn new technologies and excel as a data engineer.

    description: "Developed a monitoring system for Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration team. A Bash script was used to instantiate a Docker container for a PostgreSQL database, and relevant tables were created using SQL DDL. Implemented another Bash script that parses host system hardware specicifications and resource usage and inserts the data into the tables. The resource usage data is automated with crontab to populate a new row every one-minute. Designed SQL queries to answer business questions, such as the average resource usage in a 5-minutes interval for each host server. Utilized Git for version control and upload to GitHub according to GitFlow workflow standards."
